The `src` folder contains up to date and clean code. Use this for your own projects. 
The `nbs` folder may contain outdated code and is not clean. It may not run out of the box and might not be the easiest thing to understand. However, they may contain useful information for some people (mainly if you haven't done any NLP before), so inspect them if you need. Note: Some of those nbs where used in Google Colab, so they might not run locally without some mods.
